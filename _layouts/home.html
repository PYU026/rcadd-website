            <em>MA Digital Direction is the future of storytelling.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the last 15 months, we have been wondering what this means.

        </p>
        <p>
            Through workshops and collaborative projects emphasizing both criticality and play, our course has been
            investigating how narratives mediate and are mediated by (post<span class='dash'>–</span>)digital technologies. Our work is not
            technologically determined, though. Digital Direction is truly driven by exploring and challenging the
            limits of
            storytelling across social and political contexts. This year’s final works engage with the climate crisis,
            cultural heritage, spirituality, communal experiences in music and the virtualities of storytelling
            itself<span class='dash'>–</span>to name a few. While these projects all incorporate emergent or immersive technologies, they do so as works of
            theatre,
            robotics, film, sound, VR, writing and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Digital Direction, while difficult to define, has supported us in mapping out new storytelling practices
            that by
            no means point in a single direction. Let us show you 23 directions it could take you.
